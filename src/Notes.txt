Can use callable statement for procedure
can use Statement / Prepare statement

if you want insert / update you can use execute update. which will make some changes in the database

the execute query returns ResultSet. Just imagine the ResultSet as the table format

========================================================================================================

*) Issue with "Statement" - it is a string based sql query. means its a static and coder have to always pass the content.

*) "PreparedStatement" - Used to execute parameterized SQL queries
